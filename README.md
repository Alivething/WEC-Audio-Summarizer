# WEC-Audio-Summarizer
**Audio Summarizer Project under WEC Intelligence **

Goal: To create a system that can use Audio input and provide a summary in the form of a short text block

**Objectives:**

1) Audio input and preprocessing
2) Audio to text conversion model
3) Text summarization system

**Tasks:**

Tasks 1: Audio input, preprocessing and conversion
Chinmaya & Ashitosh under Vaishali

Tasks 2: Text summarization system
Ankit and Satyam
